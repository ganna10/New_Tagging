* This file contains extra reactions which produce tagged species
* All consumption reactions should already be accounted for in the ho2_tags and ox_tags files

* Inorganic reactions producing HO2
* (HO2NO2 is already included as a reservoir species in the ho2_tags file)
* (reactions of OH with O and O3 producing HO2 are already accounted for in chem_mech_ox_tags_voc.in)
 H2O2 + OH -> HO2_X_XTR + H2O2 + OH ; 2.9e-12, -160

* Inorganic reactions producing O
 [jo2_X_STR->,jo2_b] O2 + hv -> 2 * O_X_STR + O2
 [jn2o_X_STR->,jn2o] N2O + hv -> O1D_X_STR + N2O
 OH + OH -> O_X_XTR + 2 * OH ; 1.8e-12
